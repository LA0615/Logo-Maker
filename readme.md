# Logo Maker Svg

## Description

This project was made with npm inquirer, node, and jest. This was made to practice skills I recently learned regarding the importance of testing code to looking for specific things that the code will pass or fail. This project incorporated an svg file and three shapes that a user is able to select , with prompts,and customize colors and text.
